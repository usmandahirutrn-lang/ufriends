## Goals
- Use your blank background `/assets/premium-blank.jpg` (normalize backslashes) at exact 1080×674.
- Render two stacked cards: top is the NIN slip, bottom is a white disclaimer card with identical size, positioned directly beneath (like your sample). Optionally rotate the disclaimer 180° for fold/laminate printing.
- Ensure photo from provider (base64) is converted to a proper data URL and placed correctly; ensure QR fallback is generated when missing.

## Template Changes
- Switch premium slip to a two-card page:
  - Page size: `@page { size: 1080px × (674px × 2 + gutter); margin: 0 }` with a small separator gutter (~20px).
  - Card 1 (top): background image `/assets/premium-blank.jpg`, overlays for labels and dynamic fields.
  - Card 2 (bottom): solid white background, disclaimer text block matching your sample; optional `transform: rotate(180deg)`.
- Normalize `/assets\premium-blank.jpg` → `/assets/premium-blank.jpg` everywhere (builder and resolver).

## Overlay Alignment (Top Card)
- Place elements using exact pixel coordinates for 1080×674:
  - Photo: left panel (object-fit: cover)
  - QR: right of the header
  - NGA and Issue Date: below QR
  - Labels: SURNAME/NOM, GIVEN NAMES/PRENOMS, DATE OF BIRTH, SEX/SEXE
  - Values: `{{surname}}`, `{{given_names}},`, `{{dob}}`, `{{gender}}`
  - NIN label and spaced digits `{{nin_spaced}}{{nin}}` along the bottom

## Disclaimer Card (Bottom)
- White card same size (1080×674) containing:
  - “DISCLAIMER” title, “Trust, but verify” subtitle
  - Body lines (exact wording from your sample), “CAUTION!” section
  - Optional rotation by 180° to mirror the sample for folding

## Data & QR Handling
- Photo: convert base64 to `data:image/jpeg;base64,...` (already in place), ensure it’s used consistently even when nested under `nin_data`.
- QR: if provider doesn’t return `qr_code`, auto-generate a small PNG based on `{ nin, surname, given_names, dob, issue_date }` and embed as data URL.
- NIN digits: show grouped when length=11; otherwise show raw.

## Builder Integration
- Expose a preset for 1080×674 canvas; allow “Use image intrinsic size” to auto-match.
- Keep per-element font/size controls for fine tuning.

## Verification
- Generate a premium slip and confirm:
  - Full-frame top card alignment
  - White disclaimer card directly below (rotated if selected)
  - Photo rendering from base64
  - QR present (provider or fallback)

## Deliverables
- Updated premium template with two-card layout and correct dimensions.
- No changes needed to user flow; selecting slip type “Premium” resolves the new layout.

## Confirmation
- Approve this plan and I’ll implement the two-card layout, align overlays to 1080×674, add the disclaimer card beneath, ensure base64 photo conversion, and keep the QR fallback.
